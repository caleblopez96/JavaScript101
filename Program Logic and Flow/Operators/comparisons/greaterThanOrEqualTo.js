// used to compare two values or expressions to check if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. 

// EXAMPLE: 
5 >= 3;   // true, because 5 is greater than 3
3 >= 5;   // false, because 3 is not greater than 5
5 >= 5;   // true, because 5 is equal to 5 (greater than or equal)
